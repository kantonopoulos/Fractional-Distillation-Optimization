# Fractional Distillation Optimization

## Description

Fractional Distillation Optimization is a scenario-based inhouse algorythm that determines the optimal design characteristics of a fractional distillation column, such as the reflux ration, the number of trays, the feed location and many more. The code is built based on the Lewis-Matheson method, material and energy balances, as well as vapour liquid equilibrium (VLE) data. The code was tested on a case of ethanol-water mixture separation.

Some of the features of Fractional Distillation Optimization include: 

* Optimization of reflux ratio, number of trays and feed location
* Distillate and bottoms flow rates, boil-up ratio, diameter, height, condenser and reboiler duties and opperating temperatures, hot and cold utilities calculations 
* Economical assessment
* Run multiple scenarios with different mass fractions in feed, distillate and bottoms
* Run multiple scenarios with different feed flow rate
